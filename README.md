CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.

In this code:

1. We define a dictionary called responses where keys are user queries, and values are corresponding chatbot responses.
2. The chatbot() function starts by greeting the user and then enters a loop to continuously prompt the user for input.
3. The input is converted to lowercase to simplify matching. If the input matches any predefined query, the chatbot responds accordingly. If the input is "quit," the chatbot exits the loop and says goodbye.
